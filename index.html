	&nbsp; Hello! As you can tell from the massive writing up above, my name is Raymond Patt, or just Ray! I am an undergraduate student at The Ohio State University studying Neuroscience and Linguistics with a cognitive/computational focus. Due to the nature of my coursework, I'll also be getting a minor in computer and information sciences along the way! One of my primary interests is Language; I've been encapsulated by it for years. As a kid I used to spend hours on end looking up languages resources-- for languages I didn't even plan on learning! I loved having the wealth of my knowledge at my disposal, and constantly pushed those around me to learn the language that entranced me that week. (This week I'm interested in <b> <i> Nahuatl </b> </i>!) More specifically, I am interested in how we can use computers, especially Artificial Intelligence, to aid in second language acquisition and testing.
